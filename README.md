# PizzaParty

A fast and easy way for new remote teams to break the zoom ice. Through a shared link, the group quickly throws together an interactive album, immediately dipping their toes into the collab spirit. During their first few days working together, members can revisit the page to remind themselves of who is who, where everyone lives, and what was the name of that fun person that â€”against all oddsâ€” hates Hawaiian.
